Long story short; I'm not dead. 

I took a break from developing stuff for awhile because it started to feel like a job again. I'm not doing that again. To counter the feeling I just backed off and put things to the side for a bit. 

Good news, I'm sort of back to coding again. I've worked on a few side projects (not related to e107), one of which will be powering this site when I get a little more finished on it. Another one is something for my personal use, but I'll speak more about when it's ready (protip: if you follow me on GitHub you will see the commits for any projects discussed in this post). Finally, I'm going to work on writing a plugin for e107 that utilizes Google Calendars to display events for your calendars. 

Finally, I'm dipping into a little bit of Android app development. So if you own an Android phone and want to test my crappy apps, keep an eye on this site for updates!
