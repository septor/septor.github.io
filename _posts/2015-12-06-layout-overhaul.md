I know, I know.

I've decided to switch up the layout a bit. This one has more going for it than the last one, and it'll be easier to expand on in the future.

I don't know if this was possible in the old layout, but I can do things like include Gists:

{% gist septor/4273534 %}
_Note: The code in the above Gist may not work any longer._

Which I guess could be helpful in the future.

Anyways, I really only made this to fill some content up and to inform anyone reading that I'm not going to fully focus on the plugins mentioned in the previous post.
