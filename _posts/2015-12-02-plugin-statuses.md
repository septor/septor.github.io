Chances are you if you're reading this and you're waiting on one of my plugins to be updated, fixed, whatever -- you're curious why, or how, I have time to push out little updates to already released plugins or to create new repos for new plugins, or maybe even how I have time to make this blog (and these posts). Let me go over each plugin and detail what I'm going with them. I'll list them in the order in which they'll get attention.


**ShowOnPages**

Basically this is getting a tiny rewrite. I'm mostly done with the big chunks I just need to fine tune it and make it function correctly. I need testers when It's finally released, so if you're interested follow the [repo](https://github.com/septor/showonpages/) for commits on when these changes go live.


**Recruits**

Let's take some time to consider that I would, or felt like, updating [wowrecruit](https://github.com/septor/wowrecruit/) or [riftrecruit](https://github.com/septor/riftrecruit/). Alright, now stop. I'm not doing that.

Instead I'm going to create a new recruitment plugin that will be more flexible in what you can recruit for. I don't have a lot hashed out for this yet, but I'm fairly sure there will be XML files that store some information on what kind of recruitment you plan on doing. For now, I have some mock files written up for World of Warcraft, Rift, and Wildstar. All of these are MMOs. I've considered writing up some for sports, but I don't follow that crap so..


**Form Builder**

Ah.. the Survey "rewrite". For now, it's kind of on hiatus again. I'm doing my best to understand how some of the Bootstrap Form Builders save the data generated when you create your forms so I can utilize it.. but I'm not grasping it. I'm open to tips.

Until the above is ironed out, this plugin is on hold.


### Everything Else!

I'm also working on [urkQuotes](https://github.com/septor/urkQuotes/), but it's kind of a personal project meant to take over for the backend I wrote for [chickfights.us](http://chickfights.us) so I'm in no hurry to do a lot with it since moving that site to e107 requires me to port the frontend to an e107 theme. I dislike frontend dev, so that'll be awhile.

I also plan on helping out with the e107help community platform dev work. That could potentially take a front seat when the time comes. We'll find out together!
