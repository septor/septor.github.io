I've been working on two new plugins for e107. Neither of them are new concepts, and there's probably already plugins of their nature floating around for v1 of e107. However, there's very few plugins that work for v2 (or are built for v2) of this nature. So, let's begin.

## Forecasty

A weather plugin using Forecast.io to gather it's data. Eventually there will be shortcodes to present the user with a short description of what is happening, and that description will have a vulgarity level.

The one-liners that will be used will be posted after the feature is implemented. I'm not sure how multilingual they will be, but hey. That's up to the translators!

I'm toying with the ability to just put the data into a database, that way anyone can add any type of one-liner they want for the weather condition.

## Scrobbls

I used Last.fm awhile ago to track my music listening. The only reason I don't use it right now is because I'm rarely on my desktop. That doesn't mean that I don't want to display my listening habits at all, or won't ever want to.

Scrobbls is my first attempt at doing mostly OOP (as much as I can manage). I'll be building the `_class.php` file up as I write output files (menus, pages) to display the content.

Since this is still very early in the development I can't go into much more detail on anything else.
