In short, without rambling too much, here is what is going on:

* I needed a place to announce my coding releases, since not everything is e107 related.
* I needed a place to announce new projects, even if they are e107 related.
* I needed a use for the domain name.
* I think Jekyll is pretty swell, and this saves me from making an e107 theme to do the same thing.

If you're wondering -- not this probably won't last long, but it's the effort that matters. Right?
